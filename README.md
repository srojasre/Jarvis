# Jarvis: Your Personal Fictional Assistant

Jarvis is a Python program designed to emulate the functionality of a fictional character of the same name, inspired by the concept of the AI assistant in Iron Man. Jarvis is programmed to interpret messages, execute actions based on those messages, answer general questions, and analyze data as per user instructions.

## Features

- **Message Interpretation**: Jarvis can interpret messages provided to it and determine the appropriate action to take.
- **Action Execution**: Upon interpreting a message, Jarvis can execute various actions such as controlling devices, retrieving information, or performing tasks.
- **Question Answering**: Jarvis is capable of answering general questions by accessing relevant databases or resources.
- **Data Analysis**: Jarvis can analyze provided data sets and generate insights or summaries as required.

## Getting Started

To get started with Jarvis, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the Jarvis repository to your local machine using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jarvis.git   
2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the cloned directory and install the required dependencies by running:
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. **Run Jarvis**: Execute the `main.py` script to start Jarvis:
python jarvis.py

4. **Interact with Jarvis**: Once Jarvis is running, you can interact with it by sending messages and observing its responses.

## Usage

Jarvis can be used for various purposes including:

- **Home Automation**: Control smart devices in your home by sending commands to Jarvis.
- **Information Retrieval**: Ask Jarvis questions to retrieve information from the web or local databases.
- **Data Analysis**: Provide data sets to Jarvis for analysis and receive insights or summaries.
- - **Functions**: Not implemented

## Example

```python
from jarvis import Jarvis

# Initialize Jarvis
jarvis = Jarvis()
jarvis.start()

# Send a message to Jarvis
""Hey jarvis turn de light on on living room""

# Expected answer
""Ok, light on [**Ligts], something more?""
```
In this example, Jarvis receives a message requesting to turn on the lights in the living room. Jarvis interprets the message and executes the corresponding action.
